function [x, C, multiplicity, numberOfIterations] = multiplicityEvaluation(f, fDerivative, startPoint, tolerance, maxIterations)
% MULTIPLICITYEVALUATION Evaluates the multiplicity of the solution with
% the Newton method.
%
% [x1, x2] = parabolaSolver (a, b, c)
%
% Given a parabola equation like axÂ² + bx + c = 0
%
% Input:
% f - 'f' function in the equation 'f(x) = 0'
% fDerivative - derivative of f
% startPoint - starting point of method
% tolerance - epsilon at which stop method (i.e when |f(xn) - 0| <
%             epsilon)
% maxIterations - max number of iterations to execute
%
% Output:
% x - the solution of the equation f(x) = 0
% C - error asyntotic constant
% multiplicity - multiplicity of the solution
% numberOfIterations - number of iterations executed before getting
%                      solution
