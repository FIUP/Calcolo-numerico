function [c] = chebyshevPolynomia(n)
% CHEBYSHEVPOLYNOMIAL: Finds the coefficients of the n-degree Chebyshev
% polynomial.
%
% [c] = chebyshevPolynomia(n)
% 
% Input:
% n - degree of the polynomial
% 
% Output:
% c - vector with the coefficients. The coefficients are given in reversed
% form, that is c = [3 1 4] means the polynomial is 3xÂ² + x + 4.
